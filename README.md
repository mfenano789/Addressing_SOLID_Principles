# Addressing SOLID Principles

This project demonstrates the application of the SOLID principles in object-oriented programming. The code showcases various violations and solutions for each of the SOLID principles, such as the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Open/Closed Principle (OCP), and Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP).

## Introduction
This project serves as an educational tool to demonstrate how to properly apply the SOLID principles. The SOLID principles are key to writing maintainable, scalable, and flexible object-oriented code. In this repository, you will find:
- **Violated Code**: Where each principle is violated.
- **Solved Code**: Where the principle is properly implemented.

## Principles Addressed
The following SOLID principles are addressed in this project:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correct functioning of the program.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:


## Setup
To get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
